  "readme": "# hostile\n### Simple, programmatic `/etc/hosts` manipulation (in node.js)\n\n![hostile](https://raw.github.com/feross/hostile/master/img.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install hostile`\n\n## OS Support\n\n- **OS X** and **Linux**: Assumes hosts file will be at `/etc/hosts`.\n- **Windows**: Assumes hosts file is at `/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`.\n\n## Must run with `sudo`\n\nIf your OS requires admin privileges to edit the hosts file (most OSs do), then you'll need to run your node script with `sudo`. I use `hostile` in a command line script, so running with `sudo` is easy and not a security risk.\n\nI wouldn't recommend running your production node server with admin privileges unless you downgrade to a normal user with [`process.setuid(id)`](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_setuid_id) before you start accepting requests.\n\n## Simple Usage\n\n```js\nvar hostile = require('hostile')\nhostile.set('127.0.0.1', 'cdn.peercdn.com', function (err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err)\n  } else {\n    console.log('set /etc/hosts successfully!')\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis adds a rule to /etc/hosts. If the rule already exists, then this does nothing.\n\n```js\nhostile.remove('127.0.0.1', 'cdn.peercdn.com', function (err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err)\n  } else {\n    console.log('set /etc/hosts successfully!')\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis removes a rule from /etc/hosts. If the rule does not exist, then this does\nnothing.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nFor other features (not documented), see `index.js`.
